# unfortunately there is no separate gffread flag for a genomic sequence index;
# genome FASTA file should be accompanied by FASTA INDEX (.fai) file

# gffread will create the index on-the-fly and save it alongside the genomic sequence
# (thus, the user requires write permission to the directory below in such scenario)
